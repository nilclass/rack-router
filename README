This is my awesome rack router.
Mad props to Josh Peek, a lot (most?) of the concepts come from him.


TODO:

* Freeze the route object when it gets compiled

Some points for discussion:
---------------------------

* Caching the request object
* Passing routing parameters to the app.
  Currently with env['rack_router.params]
* How should an application tell the router that it cannot handle
  the request?
  Currently this is with a custom header
* Should I pass in the matched route in the env
  Currently with env['rack_router.route']
* Should I allow an arbitrary hash to be set on the route (so that you
  can track any information).
* How should multiple request objects be handled in context of mounting.




* Be able to provide route paths using the internal array / string / symbol representation
