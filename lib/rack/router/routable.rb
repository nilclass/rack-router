class Rack::Router
  # Mixin that can be used by any Rack application to provide routing
  # to any number of child rack applications.
  #
  # Features:
  # ---
  # * Set conditions on any method provided by the request object
  # * Rewrite the request before passing it to the child rack application
  # * Mount any number of child router objects inside a parent.
