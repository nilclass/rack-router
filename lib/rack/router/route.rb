    # when the route is matched.
    #
    # ==== Formats
    # "/simple/path"   The string literal is what env["PATH_INFO"] gets set
    #                  to.
    # "/with/:capture" The placeholder gets replaced with the associated value
    #                  in the captures extracted from the request by the route.
    # nil              Whatever remains in the current env["PATH_INFO"] after
    #                  the matched portion has been removed. This could be an
    #                  empty string.
    #

    attr_reader :path_info
    
    # A Hash containing the conditions that are used to match the route against
    # the request. The keys are the request method names, the values are the
    # conditions.

    # A Hash containing conditions to use for each dynamic segment.

    # A Hash containing default rack_router.params to use when the route
    # is matched. Any parameter extracted from the request takes
    # precedence over the ones specified here.

    # :api: public
